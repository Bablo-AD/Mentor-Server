My journal: [\"12.06.23 So today i woke up at 8:15ish brushed my teeth wrote gratitude my mind was fresh and clear Gone upstairs to get some sunlight. Came to poop the poop was light yellow. Exercised with the home workout app it was a good workout i am noticing that i am kind off breathing through my mouth these days it is bad i would like to fix it. Then i took bath with new shampoo from homeopathy thing i liked it next i went to post office to post some books that makes some kids learn. Next I came home turned on AC started to go over the email sent by the non-trivial got some interested about the 8000 hours thing then everything collapsed i relapsed and things went haywire i took some powernap then some thinking to get back track and gone to ibaco ice cream to get my mind to actually post in order to stay motivated and building stuff. The internet was less but i did my best then i played with a cockroach it was big and scared me a ton. Anyway the things went wrong are \\\\n- I didn\\'t stay in the place where i would be productive\\\\n- I should have made a decision to walk instead of fapping up\\\\nAnyway i did it so now the only plan is to get away from this is to get up and do things on my purpose like have rigid plans to work on so for tomorrow the iteration 2 starts the main important stuff about iteration 2 is integrating Bablo and Mentor. First integrate Bablo and Mentor app and make them work together.THIS IS MY PURPOSE AND I DO IT.t\", \\'10.6.23 Today I woke up brushed teeth done some walking passed of by light yellow poop. Done some exercise by walk and gone to my bros house to play some cards and stuff and i am not gonna discuss about it i am gonna discuss about the shape work that i have been producing so \\\\n\\']'},\n",

    "  'content': \"Thank you for sharing your habits and journal entries with me. It's great to see that you have a variety of positive habits such as gratitude journaling, exercising, and spending time in sunlight. \\n\\nHowever, I noticed that on June 12th, you had a setback and struggled to stay productive. It's important to acknowledge these moments and reflect on what led to them, as you have done in your journal entry. It's also great to see that you have a plan to improve and have set a specific goal for iteration 2. \\n\\nOne suggestion I have is to prioritize your habits and tasks each day. It can be overwhelming to try to do everything on your list, so consider focusing on the most important ones first. Also, try to eliminate any distractions or factors that may lead to unproductive behavior. \\n\\nOverall, keep up the good work and continue to reflect on your progress and areas for improvement.\"}]"
